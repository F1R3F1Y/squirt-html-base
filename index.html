The growing demand for organic products creates opportunities for farmers. Information on the consequences
of management practices can help farmers transition to organic and take advantage of these
prospects. We examined the interaction between soil disturbance and initial cover crop on naturally
occurring entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) during the 3-year transition to organic production in a feed grain
rotation in central Pennsylvania. Our experiment included four systems comprised of a factorial combination
of two levels of primary tillage (full vs. reduced) and two types of initial cover crop (timothy/clover
vs. rye/vetch). The cropping sequence consisted of an initial cover crop, followed by soybean, and
finally, maize. The entire experiment was replicated in time, with the initiation lagged by 1 year. We
detected four species of EPF (Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana, Isaria fumosorosea, and Isaria
farinosa) by bioassay of soil samples collected four times during each field season. The latter three species
were detected infrequently; therefore, we focused statistical analysis on M. anisopliae. Detection of M.
anisopliae varied across sampling date, year in crop sequence, and experimental start, with no consistent
trend across the 3-year transition period. M. anisopliae was isolated more frequently in the systems initiated
with timothy/clover cover crops and utilizing full tillage; however, we only observed a tillage effect
in one temporal replicate. M. anisopliae detection was negatively associated with soil moisture, organic
matter, and zinc, sulfur, and copper concentrations in the soil. This study helps to inform farmers about
management effects on soil function, specifically conservation biological control.
